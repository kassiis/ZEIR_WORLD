## Overview
Welcome to the **Zeir World** reference — a compact, lush toolkit for writers, game designers and creators who love *building entire worlds* rather than only writing single stories. This repository collects the ruling system, social strata, and the philosophical schools that give the realm its unique flavor: long-lived beings, the life-force called **Zeir** (mana), and institutions that function like religions but teach techniques and crafts instead of worship.

## What makes this world unique
- **Power-as-culture:** Zeir (mana) is a scarce, life-extending resource that shapes politics, economy and lifespan.  
- **Institutional schools (not religions):** *The Great Schools* are intellectual and practical academies (combat, arcane arts, agriculture) founded by mythical beings — they spread like faiths but offer curricula, training and apprenticeships.  
- **Hybrid authority model:** A semi-feudal, semi-centralized system: the **Sultan** rules from the center while powerful **Dukes (Dawsq)** manage semi-hereditary fiefs (iqta‘iyat). Local governance runs through titles like **Day** (minister), **Agha** (general), **Baylim** (regional overseer), **Zikh** (provincial chief), and **Mushrif** (town manager).  
- **Longevity impacts society:** Very long lifespans cause slow social change, deep institutional memory, and layered politics.

## Key components (quick reference)
- **Supreme:** Sultan — “Shadow of Zeir” — ultimate authority and ceremonial head of the School of the Throne.  
- **Advisory:** Diwan — Council of Senators (usually Dukes). Meets twice yearly; summoned in crises.  
- **Executive:** Day (Prime Minister), Agha (High General).  
- **Regional:** Baylim (fief overseer), Zikh (province/tribal leader), Mushrif (city manager).  
- **Nobility tiers:** Duke (Dawq) → Don → Von.  
- **Administrative structure:** Iqta‘iyat (fiefs) → Provinces → Central strategic provinces (capital, mana-rich zones).
